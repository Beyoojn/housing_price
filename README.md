# Housing Price Prediction Project 
## Problem Statement 
The real estate market is highly dynamic, with housing prices influenced by a variety of factors such as location, property size, age, and more. However, accurately predicting housing prices remains a challenge due to the complexity and variability of these factors. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a predictive model that can accurately estimate housing prices based on key features. The goal is to provide real estate professionals, investors, and homeowners with a reliable tool to make informed decisions.

## Role
As a data scientist, your role is to clean, analyze, and model housing data to build a predictive model that estimates property values. This involves understanding the relationships between various housing features and their impact on prices, as well as selecting and fine-tuning the appropriate machine learning algorithms to achieve the best results.

## Goals
1. <b>Accurate Housing Price Prediction</b>: Develop a model that can predict housing prices with high accuracy, enabling better decision-making in the real estate market.
2. <b>Feature Impact Analysis</b>: Identify and quantify the most influential features that affect housing prices to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
3. <b>Model Optimization</b>: Fine-tune the predictive model to ensure it performs well across different data subsets and generalizes effectively to new data.

## Objectives
1. <b>Data Cleaning and Preparation</b>: Handle missing data, remove outliers, and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.
2. <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>: Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the distribution of the data, identify correlations, and discover trends that influence housing prices.
3. <b>Model Development</b>: Build multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression) and evaluate their performance in predicting housing prices.
4. <b>Hyperparameter Tuning</b>: Optimize the selected models to improve accuracy and reduce prediction errors.
5. <b>Model Evaluation and Validation</b>: Assess the models using cross-validation and test them on unseen data to ensure robustness.

## Business Metric
1. <b>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</b>: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, providing a straightforward interpretation of the model’s accuracy.
2. <b>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</b>: Assesses the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values, penalizing larger errors more heavily.
3. <b>R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)</b>: Evaluates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit.
4. <b>Median Absolute Error</b>: Provides a robust measure of prediction accuracy that is less sensitive to outliers, offering a complementary perspective to MAE and MSE.
